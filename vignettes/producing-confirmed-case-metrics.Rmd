This document provides an under-the-hood walk-through of the steps used to 
produce an output for the confirmed case metrics for ingestion into Tableau
using the functions in the {`ohiCovidMetrics`} package. These functions were
written up to the specifications in the [Confirmed Case Metric Reproducibility 
Document](https://share.health.wisconsin.gov/ph/inf/drrb/Meetings/BBB%20Metrics%20Discussions/Indicator%20Development/OHI_BBB_Surveillance_ConfirmedCaseMetric_Reproducibility_20200615.docx) 
on the OHI Surveillance Team's SharePoint site.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(ohiCovidMetrics)
library(readxl)
```

## Pulling the data

Eventually, this package will contain multiple ways to pull the data depending 
on the user's level of access. In this vignette, we will grab data from the 
public facing [COVID-19 Historical Data Table](https://data.dhsgis.wi.gov/datasets/covid-19-historical-data-table) via
an API call with the `pull_histTable()` function which takes no arguments. Note,
I stopped the time series at 17 June 2020 to be able to comparet the results to the
official file prepared by Jeff Bond for the dashboard.

```{r pull-hist-table}
hdt_clean <- pull_histTable(end_date = "2020-06-17") 
```

This function does six things: 

1. Imports data from the REST API <https://services1.arcgis.com/ISZ89Z51ft1G16OK/ArcGIS/rest/services/COVID19_WI/FeatureServer/10/query?where=GEO%20%3D%20'COUNTY'&outFields=GEOID,GEO,NAME,LoadDttm,NEGATIVE,POSITIVE,DEATHS,TEST_NEW,POS_NEW,DTH_NEW&outSR=4326&f=geojson> 
   using the `st_read()` function from the {`sf`} package.
2. Some basic data wrangling to convert the date into the correct format and
   create the daily new confirmed cases time series.[^1]
3. Recursively corrects any reversals in the confirmed cases time series using 
   the `clean_reversals()` function. Note: this is done at the county level and 
   then aggregated up to the State level.
4. Aggregates county data up to the HERC region and state levels
5. Appends population data
6. Finally, it produces a cumulative case time-series based on the cleaned version. 

[^1]: It pulls down the new deaths and tests time series as well for more context.

The result is a data.frame where there is one row per county/HERC region/state per day.

### Preparing the data to calculate metrics

The confirmed case metrics are all based on 7 day bins looking back from the 
current date, e.g., For data ending on 10 June 2020, the 7 day bins are:

- 4 June 2020 through 10 June 2020,
- 28 May 2020 through 3 June 2020,
- 21 May 2020 through 27 May 2020,

and so on. To make things easier, we need to aggregate the daily counts 
within geographies, or regions, and 7 day bins. This is done with 
the internal `shape_case_data()` function that is called by `pull_histTable()`. 

This function:

1. Calculates the 7 day bins based on the mosts recent date in the 
   case time-series data.frame using `rolling_week()`.
2. Aggregates the case count within these bins for each region.
3. Keeps the two most recent 7 day bins and reshapes the data.frame
   to 'wide' format so that there is one row per region and one column
   per case counts in the current and previous 7-day case count.
   
Thus the data are in a format that is ready for Tableau ingestion and
that facilitates the calculations of each metric in its own column.

## Calculating Metrics

Finally, we can calculate the metrics. For production purposes, I have
wrapped all of these calculations into the `process_confirmed_cases()`
function, which takes the cleaned case time-series data as it's only
argument:

```{r metrics-all}
hdt_out <- process_confirmed_cases(hdt_clean)
```

Since this is the meat of the analysis, I want to go through them 
each, step-by-step.

### Burden metrics

See the top panel of Table 1 in the [Confirmed Case Metric Reproducibility 
Document](https://share.health.wisconsin.gov/ph/inf/drrb/Meetings/BBB%20Metrics%20Discussions/Indicator%20Development/OHI_BBB_Surveillance_ConfirmedCaseMetric_Reproducibility_20200615.docx) 
for the definitions. Following the CDC's State Indicator Report, we calculate
Burden based on the number of confirmed cases over the past 14 days per 100,000
population in the region. The numerical value of burden is calculated with the
`score_burden()` function and mapped onto the 4 categories using `class_burden()`
as shown below.

```{r metrics-burden}
burden <- score_burden(curr = hdt_clean$case_weekly_1, 
                       prev = hdt_clean$case_weekly_2,
                       pop  = hdt_clean$pop_2018)

burden_c <- class_burden(burden)
```

### Trajectory metrics

The definitions for the confirmed case metrics are shown in the middle panel
of Table 1 and the methods are described in the text that follows it. In short,
we want to pay attention both to the statistical significance of the changing 
case counts as well as the substantive significance, or magnitude, of the 
change. Thus, we calculate the trajectory as the ratio of cases in the current 
7 day period to the previous 7 day period using the `score_trajectory()` 
function. We calculate the statistical significance  using a two-sided exact 
test for equality of these two counts via the `poisson.test()` function from 
the {`stats`} package with the `pval_trajectory()` function. Once we have these
two quantities, we can classify the trajectory using `class_trajectory()`

The final trajectory based metric that we calculate is the Benjemini and Hochman's
False Discovery Rate (with the `p.adjust(method = 'fdr')` function from the {`stats`}
package). This is of most use to us at DHS since by calculating 80 p-values we should
expect 4 statistically significant trajectories to occur each week just by chance.

```{r metrics_trajectory}
trajectory <- score_trajectory(curr = hdt_clean$case_weekly_1, 
                               prev = hdt_clean$case_weekly_2)

trajectory_p <- pval_trajectory(curr = hdt_clean$case_weekly_1, 
                                prev = hdt_clean$case_weekly_2)

trajectory_c <- class_trajectory(traj = trajectory,
                                 pval = trajectory_p)

trajectory_f <- fdr_trajectory(pval = trajectory_p)
```

### Composite (Summary) confirmed case metric

The bottom panel of Table 1 illustrates how we summarize a regions 
confirmed case burden and trajectory into a single composite status.
This status is based on the cross-classification of the burden classification
and the trajectory classification and takes on one of the following three
values: Low (light blue), Moderate (blue), High (dark blue). This 
cross-classification is done with the `confirmed_case_composite()` function.

```{r metrics-composite}
composite <- confirmed_case_composite(traj_class = trajectory_c,
                                      burd_class = burden_c)
```

### Final cleaning and renaming for output to .csv

The `process_confirmed_cases()` function also does some final
cleaning: expressing trajectory in percentage point changes, rounding
burden and trajectory, renaming columns, and reordering columns to fit the 
Tableau team's requirements.

The final product is:


```{r final-output}
knitr::kable(hdt_out, 
             caption = "Confirmed case metrics output for the period ending 17 June 2020")
```

## Comparing against Jeff's calculations

The real test is to see how the estimates in these functions compare to the 
ones that Jeff produced, For reference, I am using the 17 June 2020 file that
Jeff produced ([link here](https://share.health.wisconsin.gov/ph/inf/drrb/Meetings/BBB%20Metrics%20Discussions/Indicator%20Development/OHI_BBB_Surveillance_CaseMetric_20200617.xlsx)). First we will pull it in and then
compare the our results to his. *Note: I am not comparing the Count or Rate 
columns because the Tableau team just removes them.*

***Note: I have updated the output file to meet the Tableau Team's Specifications***

## Reverse CUSUM Charts 

This information is not included in the Tableau reports, but are used to 
accumulate information from the entire time series and is especially 
useful for smaller counties or counties with smaller counts. Since these 
cases use case data from more than the past two weeks, we need to start 
with the raw data and re-aggregate it into weekly counts within regions.

```{r agg-raw-to-weekly, message = FALSE}
last_date <- max(hdt_clean$post_date)

#Prep Data for CUSUM functions
hdt_cusum <- hdt_clean %>% 
  group_by(fips, geo_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    week_num = rolling_week(date_vector = post_date,
                               end_date = last_date),
  ) %>% 
  group_by(fips, geo_name, week_num) %>% 
  summarize(
    case_weekly = as.integer(sum(case_daily)),
    week_end = max(post_date),
    .groups = "keep"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(fips, geo_name) %>% 
  arrange(fips, geo_name, week_num) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(week_num)) %>%
  mutate(
    weeks_ago = as.integer(week_num - 1),
    S_N = cumsum(case_weekly) - case_weekly[weeks_ago == 0],
    S_N_z = S_N / weeks_ago - case_weekly[weeks_ago == 0],
    WC_W = case_weekly[weeks_ago == 0],
    lower_control_limit = map2_dbl(WC_W, weeks_ago, rev_cusum_lcl),
    upper_control_limit = map2_dbl(WC_W, weeks_ago, rev_cusum_ucl)
  )

```

```{r rev-cusum-chart-WI}
plot_rev_cusum <- function(rev_cusum_df, region_name) {
  rev_cusum_df %>% 
    filter(geo_name == region_name, weeks_ago > 0) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = as.character(week_end), group = geo_name, 
                 y = S_N_z, ymax = upper_control_limit, ymin = lower_control_limit)) + 
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "red") +
