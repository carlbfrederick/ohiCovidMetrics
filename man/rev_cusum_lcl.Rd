\title{DEPRECATED: Calculates lower control limits for the reverse cusum control chart based on a
3\eqn{\sigma} significance level.}
\usage{
rev_cusum_lcl(curr, delta_t = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{curr}{vector of counts for current period (must be non-negative integer)}

\item{delta_t}{number of time periods back in time.}
}
\value{
the greatest count smaller than curr that would produce a statistically
        significant \code{\link[stats]{poisson.test}}
