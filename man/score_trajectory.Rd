\title{Trajectory Measure for Count Data}
\usage{
score_trajectory(curr, prev)
}
\arguments{
\item{curr}{vector of counts for current period (must be non-negative integer)}

\item{prev}{vector of counts for previous period (must be non-negative integer)}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of percent change
}
\description{
Calculates the percent change of the most current to previous period
counts. Values greater than 1 indicate growing; less than one
indicate shrinking. \emph{NOTE: Counts must have the same period
(e.g. both summed over 7 consecutive days.)} In order to avoid
extreme values and dividing by zeros, the ratio uses an offset of 0.5
for both the numerator and denominator as pseudocounts and is
capped at 5 (i.e. a 400\% increase).
}
\details{
The 0.5 offset was inspired by the \code{bayes.poisson.test} function from
the {BayesianFirstAid} packages uses a non-informative prior distribution
whose mean simplifies to approximately 0.5. For more information, see the
reproducibility paper on the OHI Surveillance Team's SharePoint site.
