The goal of ohiCovidMetrics is to collect all the code for calculating sub-state COVID-19 metrics.

It can be installed via:

```
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("carlbfrederick/ohiCovidMetrics")
```

*Note: Some MacOS users have found that they need to re-install their version of Xcode to 
avoid errors installing the dependency `Rcpp`.*

Be sure to check out the [NEWS file](https://github.com/carlbfrederick/ohiCovidMetrics/blob/master/NEWS.md) for the current
status of the package.
